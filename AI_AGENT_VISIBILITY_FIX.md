# 🔍 AI Agent Visibility - Where to Find It

## 🤖 **Where is the AI Agent?**

The AI agent in this app is the **AI Recommendation System**. Here's where you can see it:

---

## 📍 **Location: Main Events Screen**

### **AI Recommendations Section:**
- **Location**: Top of the event list (scrollable section)
- **When it appears**: 
  - ✅ User has completed personality test
  - ✅ No manual filters are active (no category/distance/date/search filters)
  - ✅ Events are available

### **Visual Indicators:**
- ✨ **Sparkles icon** - Indicates AI-powered recommendations
- 🏷️ **Match badges** - "Perfect Match", "Great Match", "Good Match"
- 📊 **Score-based colors** - Teal/Green/Orange badges

---

## 🎯 **How to See AI Recommendations:**

1. **Complete Personality Test**:
   - Go to Profile → Retake Personality Test
   - Or complete it from the intro screen

2. **Clear All Filters**:
   - Make sure no category filters are selected
   - No distance filter active
   - No date range filter active
   - No search query

3. **Look at Top of Event List**:
   - Scroll to the top of the event list
   - Look for "AI Recommendations" section with sparkles icon ✨
   - Horizontal scrollable cards with match quality badges

## 🐛 **Current Issue:**

The AI recommendations might not be visible if:
- Manual filters are active
- Personality filter is treated as blocking recommendations
- List is collapsed/minimized

**Fix:** Making AI recommendations always visible when personality exists!

---

## ✅ **Status:**

The AI agent (recommendation system) is working, but visibility conditions need adjustment.
