## 📱 Event Details Screen

**Current Features:**
- ✅ Event title and category
- ✅ Location with distance
- ✅ Map view with markers
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Delete button (for event creators)

**Calendar Feature:**
- ✅ "Add to Calendar" button (shows when event has date/time)
- The button appears automatically when:
  - Event has `date` field
  - Event has `startDate` field
  - Event has `eventDate` field

**Note:** If an event doesn't have a date/time (like the one in your screenshot), the button won't appear. This is expected behavior - you can't add an event to calendar without a date!
