## 🔗 **Link Button Improvements:**

### **Always Visible:**
- ✅ Link button now shows for ALL events without descriptions
- ✅ Not just when externalUrl exists
- ✅ Fallback to Google search if no direct URL available

### **Better Styling:**
- ✅ More prominent button with better padding
- ✅ Enhanced shadow and elevation
- ✅ Larger text and icons
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy

### **Smart Link Behavior:**
- **With externalUrl**: Opens direct event page (e.g., Ticketmaster)
- **Without externalUrl**: Opens Google search for event title
- Both provide access to more information

## 📋 **How It Works:**

### **When Event Has No Description:**

1. Shows empty state with icon
2. Displays helpful message
3. **Always shows link button** (prominent and clear)
4. Button text:
   - "View Event Details" (if externalUrl exists)
   - "Search for Event Details" (if no externalUrl)

### **Link Actions:**
- Opens in default browser
- Haptic feedback on press
- Error handling if link fails

---

## ✅ **Summary:**

- ✅ Link button always visible when no description
- ✅ Works even if event doesn't have externalUrl
